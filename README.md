# System requierments
All games are tested on a 2.5Ghz CPU and are single core. Just make sure your CPU can go higher than 2.5Ghz and it should work. For Hard disk or SSD room, I recommend having 1GB of free room. For screen resolution, please do nothing higher than 1920x1080. I will try to test them later on higher resolutions, but 4K and bigger is probably too big for some games. Lower resolution is better, but please don't run this on 800x600. The only reason you need a powerful GPU is if you are playing on an 8K TV, and that could be too big for those games...
