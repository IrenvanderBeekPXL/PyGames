# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| beta-2.3.x  | :white_check_mark: |
| > 3.2.x   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If there is a security issue (which I don't expect, because it's local), please shut down your terminal as fast as possible. 

Then, go to the developers issues (on github), and report the issue and tell me why you think it is dangerous to run it. I will then fix it as soon as I can.
