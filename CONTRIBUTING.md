# How to help making TerminalGames better
If you like Python, you can help by forking this repository, add or debug something, and start a pull request. Please tell me (in the pull request) what you have done, and please make comments in your code to tell me where you have done what.    
  
If you don't like Python or don't know how it works and what that snake is about, it's not a snake. But you can still help by just playing. If your program craches, please open an issue and tell me how you got there, which OS (Operating System, like Windows or Linux) you used, and which Python version you play it in. you can get the Python version by typing "cmd" in the Windows search bar (Terminal in Ubuntu) and typing "python3 --version".
